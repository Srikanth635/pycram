    Generates positions for a given set of constrains from a costmap and returns
    them. The generation is based of a costmap which itself is the product of
    merging costmaps, each for a different purpose. In any case a occupancy costmap
    is used as the base, then according to the given constrains a visibility or
    gaussian costmap is also merged with this. Once the costmaps are merged,
    a generator generates pose candidates from the costmap. Each pose candidate
    is then validated against the constrains given by the designator if all validators
    pass the pose is considered valid and added to the list of valid poses.
    After a maximum of 15 valid poses are found the validation of poses stops
    and the found valid poses are yielded as soultions for the designator.
    :param desig: The location designator for which poses should be found.
    :yield: The found valid poses for the constrains given by the designator.
